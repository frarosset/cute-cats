# cute-cats
An assignment from The Odin Project (Full Stack Javascript).

A very simple page is build, showing a random cat gif from Giphy, retieved via [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide).

Through the interface, it is possible to load a different gif, or to look up for a different gif (eg, a dog).
